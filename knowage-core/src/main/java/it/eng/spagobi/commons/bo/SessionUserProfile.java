/**
 * This class represents an user profile within a HTTP session in knowage core (it does not apply, for now, on external engines). It is different from
 * UserProfile because it represents a state that may vary during HTTP session (since the session role can be changed during session), while UserProfile is NOT
 * supposed to change during session. The UserProfile object is cached and it can be reused by backend services, and therefore it may be sent to external
 * engines. The SessionUserProfile cannot be cached because, in case the cache is expired, at the moment there is no possibility to create the user profile
 * object with its state (the current role selected in session), since state is not propagated when invoking backend services.
