Knowage is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional sources and big data systems. Knowage is the new brand for SpagoBI project: this new brand marks the value of the well-known open source business intelligence suite after significant functional and technological transformations and a new offering model. 
The suite is composed of several modules, each one conceived for a specific analytical domain. They can be used individually as complete solution for a certain task, or combined with one another to ensure full coverage of user’ requirements. 

The sub-products of the suite are:
-   BD (big data), to analyse data stored on big data clusters or NoSQL databases
-   SI (smart intelligence), the usual business intelligence on structured data, but more oriented to self-service capabilities and agile prototyping
-   ER (enterprise reporting), to produce and distribute static reports
-   LI (location intelligence), to relate business data with spatial or geographical information
-   PM (performance management), to manage KPIs and organize scorecards
-   PA (predictive analysis), for more advanced analyses
-   EI (embedded intelligence), to link Knowage with external solutions provided by the customer or third parties

Knowage supports a modern vision of the data analytics, providing new self-service capabilities that give autonomy to the end-user, now able to build his own analysis and explore his own data space, also combining data that come from different sources.
