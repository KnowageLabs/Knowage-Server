<h2>Exception Details Help</h2>

<h3>1) Exception Details Column Descriptions</h3> 
<blockquote>Each row in this report represents a recent Exception thrown from a monitored inteface.  
Interfaces included but are not limited to the JDBC interfaces such as Connection/Statement/PreparedStatement.
By default the report is sorted with the most recent queries showing at the top
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ID - An increasing integer that indicates the number of the exception since the server was last booted.
<li>StartTime - The time the exception was thrown
<li>ExceptionStackTrace - The stack trace of the exception.
<li>MethodName - The method name of the monitored interfaces method that threw the exception
</ul>


<h3>2) Exception Detail Action</h3> 

<ul>
<li>Refresh - Use current form settings to retrieve Exception detail data
<li>Reset - Erases/Removes all rows from the Exception Detail buffer
<li>Enable - Enable Exception Detail monitoring.  If already enabled this has no effect. 
<li>Disable - Disable Exception Detail monitoring.  If monitors are already disabled this has no effect.
</ul>

<h3>3) Output</h3>
<blockquote>Determines the output format for the Exception detail buffer.  Options for output are HTML, XML, and an MS Excel spreadsheet. 
HTML is the default.</blockquote>


<h3>4) Set Buffer Size (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Resizes the number of rows that are kept in the rolling Exception detail buffer.  Any current rows remain in the buffer.  JAMon does not have a 
limitation on the buffer size, so if you would like a larger buffer size then is available in the list you may edit
the jsp and add the value.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No Action - No Action indicates that the page request will not alter the buffer
<li>50 rows - 50 Exceptions will fit in the buffer
<li>100 rows - 100 Exceptions will fit in the buffer
<li>250 rows - 250 Exceptions will fit in the buffer
</ul>



<h3>5) Text Display Length (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>In some cases Stack traces can become quite large and make the report difficult to read.  By entering an integer in this field
the display of the label column will be truncated to the specified length.  Note this only affects the display and the actual data in the report is not altered.  
</blockquote>


<h3>6) Highlight (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Any text that is entered here and appears in the label column will be hightlighted
</blockquote>


<h3>7) Filter (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Filter leverages the com.fdsapi.ArraySQL class to query the JAMon data with a SQL like syntax.  
<ul>
<li>If you specify any string within the filter (something like:  com), the string will be used in a Regular Expression to
find any monitors with the given pattern in their label.   This allows you to search for monitors of interest.  Note:  A regular expression is used,
not the more typical SQL 'like' clause (i.e. '%com%').  Also the regular expressions are case insensitive.
<li>You can also enter a full ArraySQL syntax and do more complex queries on any of the JAMon columns.  
Note Strings should be surrounded by single quotes not double quotes. You can use the reports column names as part of 
your query. Examples follow:
<ul>
<li>select * from array where label like 'pageHit' or label like 'mypackage'
<li>select * from array where hits>500
<li>select * from array where label like 'pageHit' or (label like 'mypackage' and hits>500 and total>100000)
<li>select * from array where label in ('bytessent', 'bytesreceived')
<li>Or you can just put in the where clause:  where hits>500
</ul>
</ul>
