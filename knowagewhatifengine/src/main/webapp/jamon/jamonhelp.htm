<h2>JAMonAdmin Help</h2>

<h3>1) JAMon Action</h3> 

<ul>
<li>Refresh - Use current form settings to retrieve JAMon data
<li>Reset - Erases/Removes all JAMon data
<li>Enable - Enable JAMon.  If already enabled this has no effect.  It will not enable any individual monitors that have been
 disabled.  
<li>Disable - Disable JAMon.  Monitors will be disabled, but not reset. If monitors are already disabled this has no effect.
</ul>

<h3>2) MonProxy Action - Enabling/disabling various SQL/Interface monitoring</h3> 

<ul>
<li>No Action (currently=TTTT) - No Action indicates that the page request will not enable/disable what is being monitored.  The four letters
can be any combination of T and F. Each letter indicates whether SQL/Exception/Interface/ResultSet monitoring is enabled.
<li>Enable All - Enable SQL/Exception/Interface/ResultSet monitoring
<li>Disable All - Disable SQL/Exception/Interface/ResultSet monitoring
<li>Disable/Enable SQL - If SQL monitoring is currently set to 'Enable' then this choice will be 'Disable' and vice versa. Lines in the JAMon report
with labels starting with 'MonProxy-SQL', and 'MonProxy-Match' are affected by this choice (SQL text will be part of the label)
<li>Disable/Enable Exceptions - If Exception monitoring is currently set to 'Enable' then this choice will be 'Disable' and vice versa. 
Lines in the JAMon report with labels starting with 'MonProxy-Exception',are affected by this choice. 
<li>Disable/Enable Interfaces - If Interface monitoring is currently set to 'Enable' then this choice will be 'Disable' and vice versa. 
Lines in the JAMon report with labels starting with 'MonProxy-Interface',are affected by this choice. Any interface can be monitored.
<li>Disable/Enable ResultSet - If ResultSet monitoring is currently set to 'Enable' then this choice will be 'Disable' and vice versa. In addition
Interface monitoring must be turned on.  ResultSet monitoring can generate lots of data so although this is simply a special case of Interface monitoring
it can be separately enabled/disabled.  Lines in the JAMon report with labels starting with 'MonProxy-Interface',are affected by this choice. 
</ul

<h3>3) Output</h3>
<blockquote>Determines the output format for the JAMon monitors.  Options for output are HTML, XML, and an MS Excel spreadsheet. 
HTML is the default.</blockquote>

<h3>4) Range/Units</h3>
<blockquote>Display JAMon monitors that share the same range name such as 'ms.' (typically this will be units).  All columns
 for differing unit types can not be displayed in a tabular report, due to the fact that different units will often have a different number
 of columns (i.e. ranges) in the report.  For example say we have 2 types of units we track in our application:  'ms.' and '$'.  
 In the case of 'ms.' our ranges will make sense for tracking performance in a web application: 0-10ms., 20-40ms., 40-80ms.,...,up to greater than 20,480 ms.  
 If we are tracking purchases in '$', then these ranges that we use for tracking 'ms.' would not be useful.  However, the following ranges 
 could be: 0-10$, 10-20$,30-40$,...90-100$, 100-500$,>500$.  'Range/Units' works in conjunction with 'Display Cols' mentioned below.
 <ul>
<li>AllMonitors - This selection will show the basic monitoring statistics for all Monitors.  The only 'Display Cols' choice that works with 'AllMonitors' is
 'Basic Columns'.  Any other choice selected for 'Display Cols' is automatically changed to 'Basic Columns'. This is because any other 
 choice will make the number of columns in the report mismatch, and so the report couldn't be displayed properly in an HTML table.
 For the 'AllMonitors' report the Label, and units (i.e. the key) are combined in the reports first column.   
 'AllMonitors' with 'Basic Columns' is the default report when JAMonAdmin.jsp is executed without making a specific choice.</li>
<li>Range Names - This selection will allow you to choose any available Range names such as: 'ms.', 'MB', '$'.  
 When a 'Range Name' is selected all 3 choices available for the 'Display Cols' field are valid.</li>
 </ul></blockquote>

<h3>5) Display Cols</h3>
<blockquote>Determines which columns should be displayed in the report.  This field determines which COLUMNS are displayed and 'Ranges/Units' 
and 'Filter' determine what ROWS are displayed.  Options follow:
<ul>
<li>Basic Cols Only - Displays basic monitoring statistics (i.e. excludes ranges).  This allows you to look at all monitoring
 types on one screen.  The 'Label' column will contain both the 'Label' and 'Units' as well as any other key columns.  This is
 the only selection that lets you view all monitors in one report (see 'Range/Units' - 'AllMonitors'.  'Basic Columns Only' are the default when JAMonAdmin.jsp is executed
 without making a specific choice.
<li>Basic/Range Cols - Displays basic monitoring statistics plus ranges.  Ranges are of the format: Hits/Avg (AvgActive/AvgPrimaryActive/AvgGlobalActive)
<li>All Cols - Displays basic monitoring statistics plus all fields of the ranges.  This is a bit of an ugly dump, but can be 
handy when you want to view more details.  
</ul>

</blockquote>
<h3>5) Cell Formatting</h3>
<blockquote>Indicates how numeric data should be displayed.  Depending on what you are measuring you may want to have decimals appear or
not. Cell Formatting allows you to toggle between precision when viewing the monitors.  The underlying data is not affected - just the view.
Note the com.fdsapi.arrays.ArrayConverter class was used to format the data.  You can also pass any String that is accepted to
DecimalFormat.applyPattern(...)
<ul>
<li>#,### - 1.2345 would show as 1
<li>#,###.# - 1.2345 would show as 1.2
<li>#,###.## - 1.2345 would show as 1.23
<li>#,###.### - 1.2345 would show as 1.234
<li>#,###.#### - 1.2345 would show as 1.2345
<li>No Format - Shows all digits
</ul>
</blockquote>


<h3>6) Filter (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Filter leverages the com.fdsapi.ArraySQL class to query the JAMon data with a SQL like syntax.  
<ul>
<li>If you specify any string within the filter (something like:  com), the string will be used in a Regular Expression to
find any monitors with the given pattern in their label.   This allows you to search for monitors of interest.  Note:  A regular expression is used,
not the more typical SQL 'like' clause (i.e. '%com%').  Also the regular expressions are case insensitive.
<li>You can also enter a full ArraySQL syntax and do more complex queries on any of the JAMon columns.  
Note Strings should be surrounded by single quotes not double quotes. You can use the reports column names as part of 
your query. Examples follow:
<ul>
<li>select * from array where label like 'pageHit' or label like 'mypackage'
<li>select * from array where hits>500
<li>select * from array where label like 'pageHit' or (label like 'mypackage' and hits>500 and total>100000)
<li>select * from array where label in ('bytessent', 'bytesreceived')
<li>Or you can just put in the where clause:  where hits>500
</ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>7) Highlight (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>Any text that is entered here and appears in the label column will be hightlighted
</blockquote>

<h3>8) Text Display Length (optional)</h3>
<blockquote>In some cases labels (SQL statements) can become quite large and make the report difficult to read.  By entering an integer in this field
the display of the label column will be truncated to the specified length.  Note this only affects the display and the actual data in the report is not altered.

<blockquote>Links to various classes from FormattedDataSet API that were used in creating this page.

dynamic text
