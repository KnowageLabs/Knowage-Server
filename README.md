Knowage is the full capabilities open source suite for modern business analytics
over traditional sources and big data systems. Its features, such as data
federation, mash-up, data/text mining and advanced data visualization, give
comprehensive support to rich and multi-source data analysis. The suite is
composed of several modules, each one conceived for a specific analytical
domain. They can be used individually as complete solution for a certain task,
or combined with one another to ensure full coverage of user’ requirements.


Knowage is now available on [FIWARE Marketplace](https://marketplace.fiware.org/) 
as FIWARE-ready software enabler, being fully compliant with [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) 
architecture and GEs. For more information check the FIWARE Marketplace entry 
for [Knowage](https://marketplace.fiware.org/pages/solutions/59611fb5573b7cb51c44ef68).

his own analysis and explore his own data space, also combining data that come
from different sources.
