Knowage is the full capabilities open source suite for modern business analytics
over traditional sources and big data systems. Its features, such as data
federation, mash-up, data/text mining and advanced data visualization, give
comprehensive support to rich and multi-source data analysis. The suite is
composed of several modules, each one conceived for a specific analytical
domain. They can be used individually as complete solution for a certain task,
or combined with one another to ensure full coverage of user’ requirements.


This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information

from different sources.

### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?

There is absolutely no problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL 
(or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the fact that different people assign different 
interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these licenses. Due to this,
some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses
(even without _modifying_ it).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL 3.0 license  
wish to make a clarifying public statement as follows:

> Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of this
> software in order to fix a bug or incorporate enhancements is considered a derivative 
> work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e. links to) an otherwise 
> unmodified version of existing software is not considered a derivative work, and therefore
> it does not need to be released as under the same license, or even released as open source.
